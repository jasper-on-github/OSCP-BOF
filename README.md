# OSCP-BOF

This script is my personal adaptation of the script which can be found on the Try Hack Me [Buffer Overflow Prep](https://tryhackme.com/room/bufferoverflowprep) room. The only real changes I've made to it are moving some variables to a `constants` file so that I don't have to modify them on a per-file basis.
